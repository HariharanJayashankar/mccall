# McCall Sequential Search

This is a python implementation of the basic McCall search model. An infinitely lived agent makes a decision of whether to accept a wage offer which is drawn from a distribution (in this case, a uniform distribution). 

By solving a bellman equation iteratively, we can arrive at the optimal reservation wage of a individual given the wage distribution and benefits of not being employed for a time period t.
